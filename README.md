## Financial Inclusion in Africa: A Machine Learning Journey

This project was part of a [Zindi Knowledge competition](https://zindi.africa/competitions/financial-inclusion-in-africa), aimed at promoting financial inclusion in Africa. 

### Project Objective
The primary goal of the competition was to build a machine learning model capable of predicting which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account, using tabular data.

### Focus of My Work
While participating in the competition, my primary objective was to focus on learning and demonstrating the deployment of a machine learning model on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), rather than competing. That said, this repository can serve as a solid foundation if you’re interested in engaging with this Zindi project. Throughout this journey, the project turned into a comprehensive learning experience, encompassing:

- **Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the dataset and preparing it for modeling.  
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features to enhance model performance.  
- **Model Development:** Building and optimizing the machine learning model.  
- **Submission to Zindi:** Testing the model's predictions against real-world data.  
- **Model Deployment:** Deploying the trained model on GCP for real-time usage.

### Learn More
I’ve documented the entire process in a detailed article, walking you step by step through every phase of the project. From the initial data preparation to deploying the model, this guide provides valuable insights and practical advice.
